- 👋 Hi, I’m @Facudevops
I am from Argentina, I am dedicated to advanced legal and administrative studies, and this time I have decided to adapt these tasks 
with web development and artificial intelligence at the service of the client's needs. 
Currently I am with Google certifications, however learning should never end: adapting is living. Let's go!.-
- 👀 I’m interested in in web design, artificial intelligence and effective application of data science.
- 🌱 I am currently learning about the use of this platform, in order to use it as a profile for my responsive web designer certification,
A necessary step to continue my training in Javascript.-
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on real resources of technological practices in the administrative and legal field, these fields are little explored in this world
applied to technologies, for which my contribution would be dual: from my part in my knowledge,
and by the AI ​​and web technologies that merged are very promising.
